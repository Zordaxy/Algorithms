LZW compression.

Compression:
1. Create ST associating W-bit codewords with string keys.
2. Initialize ST with codewords for single-char key.
3. Find longest string s in ST that is a prefix of unscanned part of the input.
4. Write the W-bit codeword associated with s.
5. Add s + c to ST, where c is newt char in the input
Code table: trie.

LZW expansion:
1. Create ST associating string values with W-bit keys.
2. Initialize ST to contain single-char values.
3. Read a W-bit key.
4. Find associated string value in ST and write it out.
5. Update ST.
Code table: array of size 2^W
